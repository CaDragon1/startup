This application is a self-improvement tracker that connects to a google calendar system. 
This will allow the user to set personal goals, have their calendar remind them of these goals,
and track their progress in achieving them. It will also have a rudementary high-score system
that can, in the future, be replaced by an incentive structure to encourage positive habits.
