## Elevator Pitch

The hardest part of self-improvement is building up new habits. This application intends to support your habits
by incentivizing accomplishing self-made goals. It connects to a user's Google Calendar to give you reminders,
and with each accomplished task, the user gets an increase in their userscore. The userscore is a modular system
that will easily be replaced by an incentive structure popularized by addictive mobile games at a later point,
when assets are created for that purpose.

## Design
Here is a sequence diagram showing how creating a task, completing a task, and making a notebook entry
would generally work.
