# Startup
9/11/24 Created an EC2 website using AWS, set up with the class' default Ubuntu package.

**This assignment has taught me:**

9/13/24
- How to generate an SSH key
- How to connect my repositories to the CygWin shell
    *This is more of a re-learning thing than a new thing.*
- Better merge conflict strategies

9/22/24
- Caddyfile is case-sensitive
- If you screw up editing the caddy file, fixing it is currently outside my skillset. 
- Learned how to attach a domain name to my ec2 instance
- Also learned how to terminate an ec2 instance and release an elastic ip
- I kinda messed up but starting over helped me understand the process better

- HTML docs begin with the <!DOCTYPE html> tag and can contain <head>, <body>, and numerous other sub-categories
- To ssh into your website, use ssh -i "$key" ubuntu@$hostname
- css can target specific areas in html by targeting the class given to segments
- css animation is done with the @keyframes tag

HTML
- Span elements are used to group and style inline elements without changing appearance or structure

startupCss
- 

Bootstrap
- The class name can determine what your code does, such as <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">.
- data-target="#target" specifies what content is affected (my example was a button that collapses/expands text)
