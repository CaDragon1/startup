- How to generate an SSH key
- How to connect my repositories to the CygWin shell
    *This is more of a re-learning thing than a new thing.*
- Better merge conflict strategies

- Caddyfile is case-sensitive
- If you screw up editing the caddy file, fixing it is currently outside my skillset. 
- Learned how to attach a domain name to my ec2 instance
- Also learned how to terminate an ec2 instance and release an elastic ip
- I kinda messed up but starting over helped me understand the process better
